like if we want to add some property of a class to another class
then we use the concept of inheritance
like,here we want to add the getter and setter of 'x' of
class 'BaseT45' in another class named 'Derived'
let for some reason you want to print something in getX and setX
then you have to change the getX and setX of every class, so to make work more easy
the concept come inheritance
