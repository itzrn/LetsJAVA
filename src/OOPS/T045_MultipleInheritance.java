/*//multiple inheritance with the help of interfaces// (definition and how they are different from abstract classes)
//abstract classes
//packages, we can talk in detail about access specifications(public ,private, default, protected)
//keyword "this"
//abstract class: contains both abstract methods(user provides only name and signature of the methods
 and concrete methods, i.e.,with definition)
 syntax abstract class class_name{
 //set of abstract methods followed by detailed methods
}
syntax for abstract method   abstract return_type(parameter list)
Imp. points about abstract class: i) We can't create an instance for abstract class
ii) a classes can be sub classed
iii) By using abstract class object we can make a reference to its sub classes
iv)in subclass we must have to define all the abstract methods*/
