What is an interface?
Different types of members in a class?
i)data members/ attributes [static/non-static, final/non-final]
ii)methods [static/non-static, final/non-final]
iii)constructors
Note: We can declare and create instances for a class
Different types of members in abstract class?
i)data members/ attributes [static/non-static, final/non-final]
ii)methods [abstract(non-static,non-final))/non-abstract (static /non-static, final/non-final)]
iii)constructors
Note: We can declare objects of an abstract to make a reference to one of its sub class instance
An interface is purely an abstract class (only abstract methods)
i) data members (but by default they are final and static)
ii) No constructors
iii) Methods ( by default they are abstract,non-static,public)
Note: We can't declare objects
Interfaces gives information about what should be implemented.
But never gives info about how it should be implemented
Syntax: interface Interface_Name{
set of final data members
set of abstract methods;
}
at least there should be one class which implements an interface
class class_name implements interface_name{
}
