        we too want to that those methods print

        to do this we use the concept of overriding

        let we want to call meth2 of class B2by overriding
        but at the same time we also want to call the meth2 of class A
        then we will use the keyword super
        then the syntax of meth2 in class B2 will be like
            @Override
    public void meth2(){
        super.meth2();
        System.out.println("I am method 2 of class B!!");
    }
    OR, super.meth2(); can be before or after some statements in meth2() of class B2 according to your convenient
    so, basically we use super to represent same attribute or same function of super class
                @Override
    public void meth2(){
        System.out.println("I am method 2 of class B!!");
        super.meth2();
    }
    Access modifier, return type, method name are same in method overriding
