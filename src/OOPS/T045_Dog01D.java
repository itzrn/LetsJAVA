/*Binding: Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.
    1)Static Binding (also known as Early Binding).
    2)Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding).
Static binding:
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.
